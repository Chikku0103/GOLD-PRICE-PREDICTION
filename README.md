Gold Price Prediction using Python

This repository contains Python code for predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques. We utilize the Random Forest Regression algorithm to build the predictive model.

Dependencies
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Installation
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
